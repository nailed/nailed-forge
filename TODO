- Add transformer obf mappings
- Zone protection
- Add a lot of chat commands
- Login gui
- Skinsync
- Native cypher
- Command signs crash connection when mappack names are >16

Lua:
- player.keepHealth / food
- inventory management (give)
- respawn event
- join event
- leave event
- minimum food level
- minimum health level
- map.getPlayers() doesn't return dead players
- Teleport everyone to spawn after game (With mappack config)

Bugs:
- PULSE_OFF pulses on enable
- Teamwon stat type doesn't work
