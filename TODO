Todo:
- Add transformer obf mappings
- World and zone specific permissions
- Add a lot of chat commands - When nailed-web is stable and running
- Skinsync - Scrap this?
- Native cypher - Difficult to do

Lua:
- map.getPlayers() doesn't return dead players

Bugs:
- PULSE_OFF pulses on enable
- Teamwon stat type doesn't work
- NailedPlayer.netHandler is null sometimes
